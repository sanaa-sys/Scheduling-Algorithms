Instructions

     FCFS and ROUND_ROBIN user commands
     Name
     non-preemtive-29587778 - graphic display the ROUND_ROBIN  scheduler work
          preemtive-29587778 -graphic display the FCFS scheduler work

     SYNOPSIS
     ./non-preemtive-29587778 [fileName]
     or
     ./non-preemtive-29587778
          &
          ./preemtive-29587778 [fileName]
          or 
    ./preemtive-28963555
     Description
     Graphic display of the given process in the file accordinf to the choosen scheduler
     
        commands:
        ./non-preemtive-29587778 [fileName],  it reads the given fileName and display the graphic of the process execution using the 
                                              ROUND_ROBIN scheduler
	Limitaion:
			filename should be there is same directory
      
	./non-preemtive-29587778, it reads by default fileName "process-data.txt" and display the graphic of the process execution using the 
                                              ROUND_ROBIN scheduler
     
 	./preemtive-29587778 [fileName], it reads the given fileName and display the graphic of the process execution using the 
                                              FCFS scheduler
	Limitaion:
			filename should be there is same directory

	./preemtive-29587778, it reads by default fileName "process-data.txt" and display the graphic of the process execution using the 
                                              FCFS scheduler
     Overall Limitation:
     filename should be there and Process time should be a natural number, process name should not more than 10 characters.
