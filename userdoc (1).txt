PURPOSE
The purpose of these 2 programs is to stimulate First Come First Serve and Round Robin scheduling algorithms using iOL markup services
HOW TO USE
First download the following files-
create-data.c
process-visualiser.h
process-visualiser.c
non-preempt-29587778.c
preempt-29587778.c
In the command prompt change the directory using cd command to be that of these files.
Then follow the below steps
Creating file containing process data-
You can input process data in any txt file using FIT2100 process data utility.(Remember to click Save to save process data in file)
To access it type the following commands in the command prompt-
gcc create-data.c
iol -- ./a.out
The process data will be displayed in the file in the below format-
process name   arrival time   service time
Accessing FCFS simulation-
To access it type the following commands in the command prompt-
gcc non-preempt-29587778.c process-visualiser.c process-visualiser.h
If you want process data to be accessed from a file any other process-data.txt, type the following command-
iol -- ./a.out filename
otherwise type-
iol -- ./a.out
To exit from the simulation, click on the Exit button
Accessing Round Robin simulation-
To access it type the following commands in the command prompt-
gcc non-preempt-29587778.c process-visualiser.c process-visualiser.h
If you want process data to be accessed from a file any other process-data.txt, type the following command-
iol -- ./a.out filename
otherwise type-
iol -- ./a.out
To exit from the simulation, click on the Exit button
ASSUMPTIONS
Only 10 processes can be accomodated
The process name can have max 10 characters
The first process in both the algorithms will be in READY state be default
POSSIBLE ERRORS
Please note the order of arguments are not flexible.
All these files need to be in the same directory
The directory in Command Prompt should be the same as these files
